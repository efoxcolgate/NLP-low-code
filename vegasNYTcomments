The House is not that any more. They are dependent on the funders who are not a demographic -- and especially not an economic -- perfect reflection or perfect proportional copy of the electorate.\n\nIn poll after poll, about 80% of the electorate wants something done about the gun thing. Instead, we get endless thoughts and prayers from our so-called representatives.\n\nMostly, we just need to draw the line between what civilians can own vs. what the military and SWAT teams have. That's it. It's not complicated.\n\nBut because it is Congress (both House and Senate) who need to reform themselves to actually represent the electorate, but who have become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the funders of their elections, that reform won't happen. From the article, one can see that the Congress members are more interested in winning the next election than in doing what is right by their actual constituents - the voters, not the funders. \n\nOne now has to wonder, if things don't change in the \"representativeness\" of the House of Representatives, whether the people will just change the channel or will they eventually rise up?

Many issues that come to mind involve how publicly available weapons have gradually migrated toward full-on military weapons, which could be argued to have no purpose other than doing battle with US law enforcement or military. Some argue for such a need in order to battle back against repressive governments, but many others stress that guns are needed for 1. target practice, 2. hunting and 3. home defense. It is pretty hard to argue that military grade weaponry is needed for these three purposes. Casual scrutiny of manufacturers websites stress something quite different; how great shooting devastating weapons can make you feel. A good example is the bump stock attachment (http://www.slidefire.com/) that \"keeps you smiling for days\". If an important purpose of guns is to confront our military, it makes no sense to prohibit mortars, heavy machine guns and Claymore mines, since mere AR15s, even with bump stocks, are pretty inadequate.
